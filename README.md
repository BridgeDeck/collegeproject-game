A game for a college group project

# TODO
- [ ] Add instructions in this README on how to run the game as a developer or player
- [ ] Add autoloads for every major function of the game (Projectiles, Entities, Player data,  HUD display) for maximum modularity 
- [ ] Design a tutorial level (must be vertical in nature and demonstrate every movement technique)
